                The Laptop plays an important role in our daily life. Anything we want we can get only with one
mouse click. Speed, reliability, and accuracy of the computer make it a powerful tool for
different purposes. A very important and basic need of today’s modern business world is the
quick availability and processing of information using a computer. One can easily get the type of
required information within a fraction of a second. The project that I have taken is also in this
category which is used in our daily life whenever we want to purchase some items we can easily
get them at our home.
